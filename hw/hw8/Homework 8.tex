\subsection*{\probnum Isomorphish? [12 points]}
Determine whether or not each of the following pairs of graphs are isomorphic. If yes, provide an isomorphism. If not, explain why and propose a change to one of the graphs that would make them isomorphic; you do not need to provide an isomorphism in this case.

\subsection*{\probnum Euler Visits the U.S. [12 points]}
Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph of the continental U.S. where $V$ is the set of the first 48 states (excluding Alaska and Hawaii) and $E$ contains all pairs that share a border.  (Arizona and Colorado do not share a border, nor do Utah and New Mexico). A reference for the U.S. map has been provided below.

\begin{center}

	{Homework/Images/USMap1.png}
\end{center}

\begin{qparts}
	\item Does $G$ have an Euler path?  Prove or disprove.

	\item Is $G$ 3-colorable?  In other words, is there a function $f\colon V\rightarrow\{\text{red,blue,green}\}$ such that if $\{u,v\}\in E$ then $f(u)\neq f(v)$?

	\textbf{Hint:} Consider odd wheels $W_{2k + 1}$

\newpage
\subsection*{\probnum Ham and Cheese [15 points]}
A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that traverses through every vertex in a graph exactly once (starting and ending at the same vertex). How many Hamiltonian cycles are there in the complete graph $K_n$? Justify your answer.

\textbf{Note:} Two cycles are the same as long as the have the same vertices, and each vertex has the same left and right neighbors in the cycle. For instance the cycles $(a,b,c,a),$ $(b,c,a,b),$ and $(a,c,b,a)$ are all equivalent.

\begin{solution}
\end{solution}

\subsection*{\probnum Captivating Counts [14 points]}

	\item have distinct digits?
	\item are divisible by 5 or 7?
	\item are divisible by 5 but not by 7?

Justify \textbf{and simplify} your answers. You may use a calculator to simplify.

\subsection*{\probnum Commit Tea Party [15 points]}
Two committees are having a meeting. If there are 12 people in each committee, how many different ways can they sit around a table given the following restrictions? Note that two orderings are considered equal if each person has the same two neighbors (without distinguishing their left and right neighbors).

\begin{qparts}
	\item There are no restrictions on seating.
	\item Two people in the same committee cannot be neighbors.
	\item Everybody must have exactly two neighbors from their committee.
	\item Everybody must have exactly one neighbor from their committee.

\subsection*{\probnum Hiking Extravaganza [15 points]}
Prove that every complete $n$-node weighted graph (with all possible edges) with $n \ge 1$ and all distinct edge weights has a (possibly non-simple) path of $n-1$ edges along which the edge weights are strictly increasing.

\textbf{Hint:} Start by placing a hiker on each node. Try to show that the hikers can walk paths of \emph{total} length $n(n-1)$, each along increasing-weight paths.
