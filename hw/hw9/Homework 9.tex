\section*{Individual Portion}

\subsection*{\probnum How Many pa55words? [12 points]}
A password consists of exactly 6 characters, where each character is either a lowercase letter (a-z) or a digit (0-9). However, the password must contain at least 2 digits and at least 2 lowercase letters. How many different passwords are possible?

\begin{solution}

\end{solution}


\subsection*{\probnum (Not So) Round and Round [12 points]}
Suppose we have a square-shaped table which seats 3 people on each side. How many ways are there to seat 12 people at the table where seatings are considered the same if everyone is in the same group of 3 on a side?

\begin{solution}

\end{solution}


\subsection*{\probnum My backpack is too heavy [12 points]}
How many ways are there to distribute seven textbooks into eleven backpacks if \textbf{each backpack must have at most one textbook in it} and
\begin{qparts}
	\item all of the textbooks and all of the backpacks are unique?
	\item all of the textbooks are unique, but all of the backpacks are identical?
	\item all of the textbooks are identical, but the backpacks are all unique?
	\item all of the textbooks and all of the backpacks are identical?
\end{qparts}

\begin{solution}
	\
\end{solution}


\subsection*{\probnum Seeressously? [12 points]}
How many strings with six or more characters can be formed from the letters in ``SEERESS"? \textbf{Simplify your answer.} You may use a calculator to help you simplify.

\begin{solution}

\end{solution}


\subsection*{\probnum Jackpot! [12 points]}
Suppose there is a lottery where the organizers pick a set of 11 distinct numbers. A player then picks 7 distinct numbers and wins when all 7 are in the set chosen by the organizers. Numbers chosen by both the players and organizers come from the set $\{ 1, 2, ..., 80 \}$.

\begin{qparts}
	\item Let the sample space, $S$, be all the sets of 7 numbers the player can choose. What is $|S|$?
	\item Let $E$ be the event that all the numbers the player chooses are in the winning set. What is $|E|$?
	\item What is the probability of winning? As a reminder, you may leave your answer unsimplified.
	\item Alternatively we can choose a different sample space $S'$ which is all the sets of 11 numbers that the organizers can choose. What is $|S'|$? What is the event $E'$ that the player has a winning set, and what is $|E'|$?
	\item What is the probability of winning given your answer to (d)? Use a calculator to verify this is the same as your answer to (c).
\end{qparts}

\begin{solution}

\end{solution}


\subsection*{\probnum Rollin' in the Deep [12 points]}
You roll three, fair, 6-sided dice. What is the probability that the sum of the dice is less than 17?

\begin{solution}

\end{solution}


\subsection*{\probnum Addition Condition [12 points]}
A pair of six-sided dice is rolled, but you do not see the results. You ask your friend whether at least one die came up six, and they respond yes.

What is the probability that the sum of the numbers that came up on the two dice is seven, given the information provided by your friend?

\begin{solution}

\end{solution}


\subsection*{\probnum Conditional probability \& Independence [16 points]}

Suppose you put two dice in a bag: one of the dice has a 6 on every face, and the other is a standard 6-sided die. You choose one die at random, roll it, and get a 6.

\begin{qparts}
	\item If you roll the same die, what is the probability that the next roll is also a 6?
	\item If you roll the same die both times, are rolling a 6 on the first roll and rolling a 6 on the second roll independent events?
\end{qparts}

\begin{solution}

\section*{Groupwork \hwnum{} Problems}


\subsection*{\probnum The Office Allocation [15 points]}
Consider a new office building with $n$ floors and $k$ offices per floor in which you must assign $2nk$ people to work, each sharing an office with exactly one other person. Find a closed form solution for the number of ways there are to assign offices if from floor to floor the offices are distinguishable, but any two offices on a given floor are not.

\begin{solution}

\end{solution}


\subsection*{\probnum Poker Queen [15 points]}
\begin{qparts}
	\item You are dealt a five-card poker hand from a standard deck of 52 cards. What is the probability your hand has  full house (3 cards of the same rank and 2 other cards of the same rank) with the queen of hearts as one of your cards?

	\item Suppose someone selects a flush at random from the set of all possible flushes (5 cards of the same suit). What is the probability this flush contains the queen of hearts?

	\item Suppose someone selects a straight (5 cards in a row of possibly different suits) from the set of all possible straights. What is the probability this straight contains the queen or king (inclusive) of hearts? Note that for EECS 203 purposes, Aces can be high or low but not both simultaneously, so 10-J-Q-K-A and A-2-3-4-5 are valid straights but J-Q-K-A-2 is not a valid straight.
