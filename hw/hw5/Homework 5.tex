\subsection*{\probnum Easy as 3, 18, 93 [16 points]}

Let $P(n)$ be the statement that $3 + 3 \cdot 5 + 3 \cdot 5^2 + ... + 3 \cdot 5^n = \frac{3 (5^{n+1} - 1)}{4}$. In this problem, we will prove using weak induction that $P(n)$ is true whenever $n$ is a non-negative integer.
\begin{parts}
	\item What is the statement $P(0)$? Complete the base case by showing that $P(0)$ is true.
	\item In the base case we prove $P(0)$; what do you need to prove in the inductive step?
	\item What is the inductive hypothesis for your proof?
	\item Complete the inductive step, indicating where you used the inductive hypothesis.

	\textit{Reminder:} You should prove this equation using a chain of equalities, starting on one side and transforming it into the other side.  You should \textbf{not} start with the equation you want to prove and transform both sides to be equal.
	\item Explain why this proof shows $P(n)$ is true for all non-negative integers $n$.
\end{parts}

\begin{solution}
	a) $P(0)$ is the statement that $3 + 3 \cdot 5 + 3 \cdot 5^2 + ... + 3 \cdot 5^0 = \frac{3 (5^{0+1} - 1)}{4}$.\\
	Base case: $P(0)$, LHS$=3 \cdot 5^0=3$, RHS$=\frac{3(5-1)}{4}=\frac{3(4)}{4}=3$\\
	Since LHS=RHS, the base case holds.\\
	\\ b) Let $k$ be arbitary $ k \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ , want to show $P(k) \rightarrow P(k+1)$\\
	c) The inductive hypothesis is assume that $P(k)$ is true.\\

		$=3 + 3 \cdot 5 + 3 \cdot 5^2 + ... +3 \cdot 5^{k}+ 3 \cdot 5^{k+1}$ \\
		$=\frac{3 (5^{k+1} - 1)}{4}+3 \cdot 5^{k+1}$ & I.H.                  \\
		$=\frac{3(5^{k+1}-1)+ 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5^{k+1}}{4}$                   \\
		$=\frac{3(5\cdot 5^{k+1}-1)}{4}$                                     \\
		$=\frac{3(5^{k+2}-1)}{4}$                                            \\
		RHS:                                                                 \\
		$=\frac{3(5^{k+2}-1)}{4}$                                            \\
		Since LHS$=$RHS, $P(k+1)$ holds.
	\end{tabular}
	\\e) This proof shows $P(n)$ is true by proof by weak induction.\\
	This is because since the base case holds and the inductive step holds, $P(n)$ is true for all non-negative integers $n$.

		$=k+k$ & I.H.  \\
		RHS:           \\
		$=k+1$         \\
		Since $k>1, k+k>k+1$, LHS$>$RHS, $P(k+1)$ holds.
	\end{tabular}

	This is because since the base case holds and the inductive step holds, $P(n)$ is true for all positive integers $n$.

\subsection*{\probnum Splitting Stones [18 points]}
In front of you sits a pile of $n$ stones.  You split the pile into two smaller piles, count the number of stones in the smaller pile, $j$, and write down the number $2^j$. Then, for each of the two piles, you split them and write down their versions of $2^j$.  You repeat this process, splitting piles and writing down exponentials until all piles have only 1 stone in them.  Finally, you multiply together all the numbers you wrote down.

For example, if we start with 8 stones, one possible way these piles could be split is as follows:

\begin{center}\includegraphics[scale=.75]{induction.png}\end{center}

Prove using strong induction that no matter how you split the piles, the overall product you get is less than or equal to $n^ n$.

\textbf{Hint:} When there is only one stone, you cannot split the pile, and the process stops.
