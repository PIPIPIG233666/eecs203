# Vertices
Vertices are the points in a graph. They can be connected by edges.

# Edges
Edges are the lines that connect vertices in a graph. They can be directed or undirected.

# Multigraphs
A multigraph is a graph that allows multiple edges between two vertices.

# Loops
edges that connect a vertex to itself

# Directed Graphs
Digraphs are graphs with directed edges. The edges have a direction, from one vertex to another.
## Simple Digraph
A simple digraph is a digraph with no loops and no multiple edges.
## Directed Multigraph
A directed multigraph is a digraph that allows multiple edges between two vertices.

# Simple Circuits
A simple circuit is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex, with no repeated edges or vertices.

# Trees
A tree is a connected undirected graph with no simple circuits.
## THM 1
An undirected graph is a tree if and only if there is a unique simple path between any two vertices.
## THM 2
A tree with n vertices has n-1 edges.
## THM 3
A full m-ary tree with i internal vertices has n = mi + 1 vertices.
## THM 4
A full m-ary tree with 
(i) n vertices has i = (n-1)/m internal vertices and l = [(m-1)n+1]/m leaves.
(ii) i internal vertices has n = mi + 1 vertices and l = [(m-1)i+1] leaves.
(iii) l leaves has n = ml - 1 vertices and i = (l-1)/(m-1) internal vertices.
